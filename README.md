Smart QueryBot

Text to SQL Converter using AI

Introduction

Smart QueryBot is a web-based application that converts natural language queries into optimized SQL statements. It helps students, developers, and database users generate SQL queries without manually writing complex syntax. Users simply describe what they want in plain English, and the system generates the corresponding SQL query.

The project focuses on improving productivity, reducing errors, and making database querying accessible to non-experts.
